# Multiplayer-Snake-Game
Sharing one of my 1st year mini Project of Multi player Snake Game in C++ with dynamic controls (1-4 player supported).


This project implements a multiplayer snake game in C++, offering an interactive gaming experience for up to four players. The game features dynamic snake movement, customizable controls, and multiple levels with increasing challenges. Players navigate their snakes, aiming to collect food while avoiding obstacles and collisions with other snakes. Each snake's score and control configuration are displayed individually, enhancing competitiveness and engagement among players. With intuitive gameplay and engaging mechanics, this project provides a fun and entertaining gaming experience for multiple players simultaneously.
